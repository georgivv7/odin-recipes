        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage.</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef.</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion.</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed.</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste.</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>½ cup water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
